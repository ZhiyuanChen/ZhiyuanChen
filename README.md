# G' day mate, how are you doing?

I'm Zhiyuan (pronounces as Àà §-j äÀà…ëÀên), an undergraduate student at the Australian National Unversity major in Advanced Intelligent System.
I am extremely lucky to work as a research assistant under the guidance of [Dr. Pan Deng](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/paden/) at Microsoft Research Asia, focus on computational biology, especially in genome and epigenome.
Prior to this, I had been lucky to be a research intern at SenseTime supervised by [Mr. Yue Liao](https://liaoyue.net/), where I worked on self-supervised learning, transformer in vision, and ultra-large-scale neural networks.
Before that, I was a visiting student at Westlake University supervised by Prof. Changbin Yu, where I worked on robotic grasping detection.
Before that, I was a research intern at SenseTime supervised by Mr. Guangqi Chen, where I worked on object tracking, especially single object tracking.

Coding could be the thing I love most, I have contributed to multiple repositories, including [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), etc. I'm currently the maintainer of [PySOT](https://github.com/STVIR/PySOT) and [iCrawler](https://github.com/hellock/icrawler).
I am passionate about public welfare, I was a volunteer with the human settlement program of the Australian Red Cross.
And I believe the world would be better if we apply coding in public welfare, I founded [wuhan.support](https://github.com/wuhan-support) in January 2020 for COVID-19.

I am looking for PhD opportunities as well as research assistant/intern positions. Please drop me an [email](mailto:this@zyc.ai) if you are interested, you may also add me on [Messenger](https://m.me/zyc.fb) or WeChat: zyc-personal.

Please do NOT send me emails if you are having troubles to run some code or cannot reproduce some results, instead, you are more than welcome to create an issue or start a discussion and @me. I will not be answering any question via email, since it would be unfair to others.

**We ([Computational Biology Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/computational-biology-group/) at the [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/)) are looking for highly self-motivated and talented interns with deep learning background, knowledge in Biology is not required. Please drop me an [email](mailto:v-zhichen@microsoft.com) if you are interested.**
