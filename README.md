G' day mate, how are you doing?

My name is Zhiyuan (pronounces as ˈʤ-jʊˈɑːn).
I am a researcher at Deep Potential, where I work on macro molecules.
My research areas include AI4Science, computer vision, and deep learning.
I received my Bachelor's degree from the Australian National University in 2022.

Before joining DP in 2022, I used to be extremely lucky to work as a research assistant of StarBridge program & research intern of Star of Tomorrow program under the guidance of [Dr. Pan Deng](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/paden/) at Microsoft Research Asia & Microsoft Research AI for Science from 2021-2022, where I worked on Computational Biology.
Before MSR, I was very lucky to work as a research intern at SenseTime supervised by [Dr. Yue Liao](https://liaoyue.net/), where I worked on self-supervised learning, transformer in vision, and large-scale neural networks.
Before these, I used to work at Westlake University, SenseTime, and Peking University.

Coding could be the thing I love most, I have some open source projects, including [DanLing](https://github.com/ZhiyuanChen/DanLing) & [CHANfiG](https://github.com/ZhiyuanChen/CHANfiG), I'm currently the maintainer of [PySOT](https://github.com/STVIR/PySOT) & [iCrawler](https://github.com/hellock/icrawler), and I have contributed to multiple repositories, including [Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate), [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).

I am passionate about public welfare, I was a volunteer with the human settlement program of the Australian Red Cross.

And I believe the world would be better if we apply coding in public welfare, I founded [wuhan.support](https://github.com/wuhan-support) in January 2020 for COVID-19.

I am looking for PhD opportunities, please drop me an [email](mailto:this@zyc.ai) if you are interested, you may also add me on [Messenger](https://m.me/zyc.fb) or WeChat: zyc-ml.

**We ([Deep Potential](https://dp.tech/)) are looking for highly self-motivated and talented interns. Please [contact us](mailto:chenzhiyuan@dp.tech) if you are interested.**

Please do NOT send me emails if you are having troubles to run some code or cannot reproduce some results, instead, you are more than welcome to create an issue or start a discussion and @me. I will not be answering any question via email, since it would be unfair to others.

You are welcome to join me for some gaming~
