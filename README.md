G' day mate, how are you doing?

My name is Zhiyuan (pronounces as ˈʤ-jʊˈɑːn).
I am a MPhil student in the joint program of the HKU-MMLab and the Shanghai AI Lab, supervised by [Prof. Xihui Liu](https://xh-liu.github.io).
My current research interests focus on building advanced machine learning models and toolkits to solve scientific problems.

Before pursuing my graduate studies, I was a researcher with DP Tech, where I worked on macro molecules.
Prior to joining DP in 2022, I had the privilege of being a research assistant of StarBridge program & research intern of Star of Tomorrow program under the guidance of [Dr. Pan Deng](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/paden/) at Microsoft Research Asia & Microsoft Research AI for Science from 2021-2022, where I worked on Computational Biology.
Preceding my time at MSR, I was very fortunate to work as a research intern at SenseTime supervised by [Dr. Yue Liao](https://liaoyue.net/), where I worked on self-supervised learning, transformer in vision, and large-scale neural networks.
I also worked at Shanghai AI Lab, Westlake University, SenseTime, and Peking University.

Coding could be the thing I love most, I have initiated several open source projects, including [DanLing](https://github.com/ZhiyuanChen/DanLing) & [CHANfiG](https://github.com/ZhiyuanChen/CHANfiG), I am the maintainer of [PySOT](https://github.com/STVIR/PySOT) & [iCrawler](https://github.com/hellock/icrawler), and I have contributed to many other repositories, including [Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate), [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), etc.

I am also passionate about public welfare, I am a volunteer with various NGOs.

Believing in the power of coding for social good, I founded [wuhan.support](https://github.com/wuhan-support) in January 2020 for COVID-19.

I'm always open to discussions and collaborations.
If my work resonates with you, feel free to connect via [email](mailto:this@zyc.ai), [Messenger](https://m.me/zyc.fb), or WeChat (zyc-ml).

**We ([Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn)) are looking for highly passionate and talented interns. Don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:chenzhiyuan@pjlab.org.cn) if you are interested.**

For code-related inquiries or discussions, I encourage to use GitHub issues or discussions rather than email, to ensure fairness and collective troubleshooting.

And if you're into gaming, let's team up~
